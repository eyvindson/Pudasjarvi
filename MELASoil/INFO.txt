Transformation of MELA output to carbon balance (i.e. stock change) of
forest soils, both mineral, that is, upland soils (peat thickness
less than 30 cm, if I rember right), and forested peatlands (called
also drained organic soils in the calculation - most forested peatlands
are drained but I am not sure if also undrained ones belong to this catgory).


To run the program(s) go to directory R (contains all R files of
the calculation) and edit MELAToC_definitions.R according to your needs,
start R, and then  >source("MELAToC_main.R").
You should have then the result of calculation in the data frame CO2result.
See a bit more explanation in MELAToC_main.R.

The directories contain files as follows:

ParameterData: data e.g. about weather, initial state For yasso etc.
Projections: MELA output files.
Results: Meant for various output files produced in the calculation.
WorkFiles: Intermediate data (mainly amount of litter) of calculatiosn
R: The R files.
